Revision history for Perl extension Teng

0.09
        - FIXED : There was a critical bug when disconnect() (or reconnect())
          was used while transaction operations were performed. Also, this
          very likely affects long-running processes that use transactions
          as well. If you use transactions at all, upgrade is strongly
          recommended (lestrrat)
